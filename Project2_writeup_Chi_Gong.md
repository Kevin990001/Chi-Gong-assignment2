Each question should be answered with at least a single paragraph (3-5 sentence, but can be more.)


What were some challenges you faced while making this app?

Challenges:
1.How to derive a structure that is suitable for all features that will not change during the whole process, design a grid or property that will not affect other features.
2.The different requirement may change the original state, affecting the original code and require new adaptation to the code in order to make both features work.
3.The version of react changes may not work for some outdated code.



Given more time, what additional features, functional or design changes would you make
What assumptions did you make while working on this assignment?

1.I can add a timer to indicate how many clicks it need to totally be blank, or it will always be black.
2.I can add a help table to tell where is the best way to add a black cell so the game will be bigger and longer.
3.I can add 2 users to play this game, user 1 wants to be dead as soon as possible, user2 wants to be alive as long as possible.
